## Benton-Franklin Health District Dashboard Proposal

### Objective
After identifying the top health risk factors in the community, we propose to create a dashboard that would help the health officer in identifying, prioritizing, addressing, and monitoring the key public health issues in the county. The proposed dashboard would help the health officer montitor the health problems and assess the success of proposed interventions.

The main dashboard shows three large linked boxes that display the top health concerns within the community. Below each health concern is the overall progress status bar. This allows the user to quickly identify areas for improvement. In addition, a 'communicable diseases' box was added as a request from the health officer and the health district's move to more primary real-time data collection.

Once a specific health concern is selected, the goals are displayed. A similar progress status bar is also displayed for a easy overall summary of the trends.

The charts display the trends from the past few years as well as the target set by the Community Health Improvement Plan. Objectives that are a work in progress have a yellow alert. Objectives that were met have a green alert. Ojectives that were not met have a red alert. This basic color coding scheme easily allows the user to assess and monitor the health problems and interventions.
